This version gives you a new option for getting notifications in real time! Talon can now intercept push notifications from the Twitter app and render them within this app instead of the native Twitter app. This feature does require the first party Twitter app to be installed, and have notifications set up. Enjoy the update - the new feature can be found under the top option of "Notification Options"
