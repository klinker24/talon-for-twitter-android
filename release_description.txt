This update adds a new feature: you can now save tweets for later, within Talon!<br/><br/>

Don't want to publicly like a tweet, but you want to remember to come back to it later? Save any tweet by opening that tweet and hitting the three dot overflow menu. To view those saved tweets, you can add the "Saved Tweets" swipable page through Talon's settings menu.
