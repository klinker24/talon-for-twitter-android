This version adds an option to compress @mentions in replies, like the Twitter apps is now doing! ICYMI, v6.1.0 came with a new theme! Match the app bar to your dark theme background for a fully immersive experience. It also adds an option to disable profile pictures on the timeline, allows you to "peek" into content on the new profile and tweet viewers, and adds an option to use larger images on the widget. Enjoy the update!
