You now have a new option for sending longer tweets! Type a tweet more than 140 characters and you can send it via the "split tweet" option, instead of just TwitLonger. This will post your "tweet storm" directly to Twitter, by breaking apart the tweets with a counter (1/x). A great new way to manage longer content without having your followers leave Twitter! This release also makes a ton of background preparations for Android O. Enjoy the update!
