- Features:
    - user lists on their profiles
    - twitter videos
    - gallery of picture on searching
    - tweetmarker in lists
    - Night mode for themes
    - easier manipulation of lists on users profiles (view all the lists they are apart of and add/remove them from them)
    - New retweets streaming methods (need twitter4j update)

- Bugs:
    - switch mentions to save the position instead of current unread method
    - rotating device will sometimes jump to the top of timeline (better rotation on timeline!)
    - direct messages get lost if you receive one before sending and after pulling to refresh


-- Staged for Release (Roadmap) --

NOTE: These are by no means final. I work on things when I get the time and in the order that I feel is most important...
If something new comes along that I want to work on instead, then I will do that :)
Some of these things have been on here for quite awhile and I just haven't gotten to them because I keep finding new things that
I think are more important for the development of the app.

Please keep that in mind when viewing this roadmap. It is simply a rough estimate, and I will not be providing any timetable for it
either, or ETA's, so please do not ask for them

    Version 4.0
        - Activity fragment
            - Display new followers, retweeters, number of favorites, mentions
            - Create new database (should be based off the mentions with a type and title field added)
            - Adapter
                - clicking mention opens tweet viewer
                - clicking a "Retweeted by: John X. and 8 Others" opens a retweeters dialog of who. Long click opens the tweet
                - clicking on "8 people favorited your tweet" opens the tweet
                - clicking on a new follower opens up their profile
            - Background refresh service with interval settings
        - mute users for a time period
        - once a day, check if there is a new version available for the classic version by grabbing html from web page
            format: <div class="content" itemprop="softwareVersion"> 3.7.2  </div>
            compare that against the currently installed version.
            If different, redirect them to the app page on the store.


    Version 4.1 (Widget and backend)
        - expand the widget for mentions and multiple account support
        - 1x1 "tweeting" widget just to compose a tweet
        - timestamp on widget
        - Widget with an unread count
