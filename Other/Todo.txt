- Features:
    - user lists on their profiles
    - QSlide for LG
    - gallery of picture on searching
    - tweetmarker in lists
    - rotation on tweet viewer
    - Night mode for themes
    - easier manipulation of lists on users profiles (view all the lists they are apart of and add/remove them from them)

- Bugs:
    - switch mentions to save the position instead of current unread method
    - rotating device will sometimes jump to the top of timeline (better rotation on timeline!)
    - direct messages get lost if you receive one before sending and after pulling to refresh


-- Staged for Release (Roadmap) --

NOTE: These are by no means final. I work on things when I get the time and in the order that I feel is most important...
If something new comes along that I want to work on instead, then I will do that :)
Some of these things have been on here for quite awhile and I just haven't gotten to them because I keep finding new things that
I think are more important for the development of the app.

Please keep that in mind when viewing this roadmap. It is simply a rough estimate, and I will not be providing any timetable for it
either, or ETA's, so please do not ask for them

    Version 3.5 (finally make more extra pages)
        - More fragments to choose from
            - search fragment (with search box and saved search) on main timelines
            - second account mentions page on timeline
                - Update the list when new tweets are synced from the service (broadcast)
                - Use the second account when fav/retweeting/replying to tweets from this page
            - second account timeline page
            - favorite tweets fragment
            - Activity fragment
            - Trends fragment


    Version 3.6 (some random stuff that I want to do)
        - conversation indicator on tweets
        - instagram video support
        - mute users for a time period
        - swipe through multiple pictures on the image viewer
        - bug with unfollowing public lists
        - "muffle" tweets instead of simply muting them (Not sure if this is ever something that will actually come. I feel as though it may hit drastically on performance)
            - Hide them, waiting for expansion


    Version 3.7 (Widget updates)
        - expand the widget for mentions and multiple account support
        - 1x1 "tweeting" widget just to compose a tweet
        - timestamp on widget
        - Widget with an unread count
