- Features:
    - user lists on their profiles
    - QSlide for LG
    - gallery of picture on searching
    - tweetmarker in lists
    - rotation on tweet viewer
    - identify conversations from timeline
    - transparent status bar xposed
    - Night mode for themes

- Bugs:
    - browser doesn't always close when backing out of it (maybe add to a count or something to keep track of how many pages have been added)
    - false toast on local trends failed (no idea where this is coming from...)
    - switch mentions to save the position instead of current unread method
    - duplicate followers and following with low numbers



    - Doesn't show the right number of new tweets if you are switching between launcher and main app
    - change the unread count to just always show the position
    - get rid of the number of new tweets on the notification when you refresh from launcher page
    - just get the position when pulling to refresh the home timeline and that will tell you how many new tweets there were
