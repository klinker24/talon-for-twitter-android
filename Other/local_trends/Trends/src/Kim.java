/**
 * Kim makes immutable eight bit Unicode strings. If the MSB of a byte is set,
 * then the next byte is a continuation byte. The last byte of a character
 * never has the MSB reset. Every byte that is not the last byte has the MSB
 * set. Kim stands for "Keep it minimal". A Unicode character is never longer
 * than 3 bytes. Every byte contributes 7 bits to the character. ASCII is
 * unmodified.
 *
 *                  Kim             UTF-8
 * one byte         U+007F          U+007F
 * two bytes        U+3FFF          U+07FF
 * three bytes      U+10FFF         U+FFFF
 * four bytes                       U+10FFFF
 *
 * Characters in the ranges U+0800..U+3FFF and U+10000..U+10FFFF will be one
 * byte smaller when encoded in Kim compared to UTF-8.
 *
 * Kim is beneficial when using scripts such as Old South Arabian, Aramaic,
 * Avestan, Balinese, Batak, Bopomofo, Buginese, Buhid, Carian, Cherokee,
 * Coptic, Cyrillic, Deseret, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, Ethiopic, Georgian,
 * Glagolitic, Gothic, Hangul Jamo, Hanunoo, Hiragana, Kanbun, Kaithi,
 * Kannada, Katakana, Kharoshthi, Khmer, Lao, Lepcha, Limbu, Lycian, Lydian,
 * Malayalam, Mandaic, Meroitic, Miao, Mongolian, Myanmar, New Tai Lue,
 * Ol Chiki, Old Turkic, Oriya, Osmanya, Pahlavi, Parthian, Phags-Pa,
 * Phoenician, Samaritan, Sharada, Sinhala, Sora Sompeng, Tagalog, Tagbanwa,
 * Takri, Tai Le, Tai Tham, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Tibetan, Tifinagh, UCAS.
 *
 * A kim object can be constructed from an ordinary UTF-16 string, or from a
 * byte array. A kim object can produce a UTF-16 string.
 *
 * As with UTF-8, it is possible to detect character boundaries within a byte
 * sequence. UTF-8 is one of the world's great inventions. While Kim is more
 * efficient, it is not clear that it is worth the expense of transition.
