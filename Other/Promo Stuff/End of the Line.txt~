*Talon for Twitter - The Future*

Alright guys, it happened, when I started this project I knew that it would eventually - didn't think it would be this quick - and I respect the game that Twitter plays with developers, despite the majority of you hating it.

Yes, we hit the token limit. I guess I can say that I am both proud and a little sad at the same time.

When I started this app, I never imagined where it would go, where it would take me, or what I could accomplish with a little hard work and a lot of time. I open this app every day and I love what I see. I really do. I am astounded that a kid like me could accomplish something like this in just a few short months between breaks in class and late night jam sessions working out a new feature. I see my icon on my homescreen (even if some of you hate it!) and just have to be so proud of what I made, I can't even wipe the smile off my face anymore most days!

That being said, I have sacrived a lot for this app, for the community, and for Android. Obviously I love what I have done and what I have learned, but that doesn't come without costs. I doubt that many of you have ever seen an app updated this much, let alone the huge updates I have pushed out every few weeks, like I said though, it all comes at a cost. I have given this app all my time, constantly stressed, never beening able to pull myself away to take a break. It is an unimaginable amount of work that I have put in and that certainly takes its tole on the body and the mind. If ever you are looking to lose weight, just go into app developement! All jokes aside though, I desperately need a little bit of a break.

I have said it many times when I was doing the same kind of work with Sliding Messaging, but never on this scale. With that app, I always had my partner, best friend, and twin brother right along with me. When we started creating these new apps though, we decided to go solo, and looking back, despite the success and triumphs we have had, I can't help but wonder if that was the right thing to do.

Now, more than ever, I can say this with certainty, I need a break. Haha


Enough about me though, now onto the future of the app and where I plan to take it and do with it. You have all read this far just looking for one answer from me: no, I am not just going to abandon it.

An app is never really done, it can get to a point where it can manage itself for awhile, but there are always new ideas, new features, and just cool things to add.
