*Talon 4.0.0*
Well, today I am excited to take the wraps off of the latest version of Talon! This version comes with a whole host of features, updates, and fixes. Here are some of the highlights:

- Tablets in landscape mode now display 2 timelines at a time instead of one (see screenshot)
- Quick actions on tweets without expanding tweets or leaving the timeline
- Much improved tablet layouts
- Quicker account switching
- Few more activity transitions on Lollipop+
- Sytle updates for the navigation drawer
- Favorite user notifications no longer require "Home Timeline Notifications" to be turned on

I'm especially excited for the new tablet support and layouts - they have been working great for me. Greatly improved tablet support, along with quick actions are definitely the standout features for this version (and two of the most requested things, by far).

*2016 Supporter*
Along with this update, I am also adding a _2016 Supporter_ option to the app. I know it is hard to believe, but the currnet version of Talon has almost been out a year and a half now! I know that some of you use the app every day, like me, and have gotten more than your money's worth out of my work. The new _2016 Supporter_ option in settings is a voluntary contribution of $3, $6, or $10 if you like what I have been doing :)

I do want to be very clear: _becoming a 2016 Supporter does not provide you with any new features or benefits for the app_.

If you love Talon, then here is your chance to show it - chip in a few extra dollars! I work hard every day to maintain, what I believe to be, the best way to consume Twitter. If supporting further isn't something that you can do right now, no problem, continue to enjoy the app the same way that you have been the whole time.

_Why should you buy it?_
1. You have been an every day user of Talon for awhile and you feel like you have gotten more than a cup of coffee's worth out of the app.
2. You understand that development is hard. I put all my free time into this product, and I think it shows! I hope you agree.
3. You want the warm-fuzzy feeling that comes with giving a little extra for something that you enjoy and use every day.

Even the $10 Supporter option is less than $1 per month for 2016. I am willing to bet that everyone throws away much more than that into products they use 10x less than Talon!


Hope you guys are psyched about this version, built on some of the more numerous requests! Whether you will become a _2016 Supporter_ or not, enjoy it. Talon just keeps getting better. 

Let me know what you think.
