Twitter, Talon, and Material Design like never before. Bold and beautiful. All material, all speed.

Created with Android Lollipop and Material Design at it's center. Talon includes stunning and beautiful layouts, eye catching animations, the smoothness you should expect from the latest and greatest apps, plus so much more.

This isn't the Talon of the past, it has been fully rebuilt around Android Lollipop to give you the most power, speed, and style possible. You have never experienced an app like this before. You won't even be able to think about going back to your "Holo" Twitter app.

Beautiful, up-to-date layouts, designs, and neat animations isn't the only thing Talon has going for it though! The list of features is off the charts, doing everything you could ever want from your Twitter app. Here are some feature highlights:
